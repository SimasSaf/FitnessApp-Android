# FitnessApp-Android
The idea behind this app is to keep track of macro nutrients. The user would enter the food they eat and the data would be kept and provided for an easier analysis of eating habits. Personally I would like to use it myself but I will be adding more improvements to this app before that.

(x marks completed)

Initial goal:
[x]	Input calories, protein, carbs, fats
[x]	Dark theme
[x]	Display charts based on input
[ ]	Goal amount for different nutrients
[ ]	Saving feature for different food pre-sets

Also the app uses:
Firebase authentication (with google)
Firebase realtime database

Future for the app:
Implement the missing features
Have an option to cycle through the calender checking your data.
Consider changing the graphs

The only chunks of code used from other sources are graphs that are supplied with my own data.

I did not include audio in the video, not sure how important it was and this was the only way i could record, by screen recording my phone.
